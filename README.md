Flower Classification using TensorFlow and TFDS

Built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the TFDS “flowers” dataset.

Implemented image preprocessing, normalization, and augmentation pipelines.

Achieved 91% test accuracy after tuning hyperparameters and applying dropout regularization.
